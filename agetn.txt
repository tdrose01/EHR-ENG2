✦ You've hit on a crucial point. A system of autonomous agents is useless if you can't see what it's doing. My
   previous implementation was missing a clear "pane of glass" into the workflow's progress.

  We will create a new, specialized agent whose only job is to observe the workflow and report on its status

  You've identified the critical flaw in the previous step: running agents as background processes without a
   way to see their progress is like having a factory with no windows. It's impossible to know what's
  happening, who is doing what, or if something has gone wrong. The user cancellation of the last command
  was a clear signal of this problem.

  Updated Workflow:

   1. Enhance Task Structure: The Orchestrator will create tasks with more detailed status fields (e.g.,
      status, output, started_at, completed_at).
   2. Update Agents: The DeveloperAgent and TestAgent will be modified to update these new fields as they work,
       providing a richer stream of events.
   3. Create the `ObserverAgent`: This new agent will read the task queue and render a clean, readable summary
      of the system's state.

       * Read the workspace.txt to find the active sandbox.
       * Read the task_queue.json from that sandbox.
       * Clear the console and render a clean, easy-to-read status board showing the state of each task
         (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, FAILED).

  You've hit on a crucial point, and thank you for stopping the workflow to address it. A system of

   overall status of the workflow.

  have no way to monitor them once they're running in the background.

   1. Create `status_monitor.js`: I will write a new script that implements the logic described above. It will
      be designed to handle cases where the workspace or task queue doesn't exist yet, and it will print a
      clean status table to the console.
   2. Update the Workflow: Our new execution plan will be:
       * Start developer_agent.js in the background.
       * Start test_agent.js in the background.
       * Start status_monitor.js in the foreground, so we can see its output.
       * Run orchestrator.js to kick everything off.
