First, spend time thinking of a rubric until you are confident.
Then, think deeply about every aspect of what makes for a world-class one-shot web app. Use that knowledge to create a rubric that has 5-7 categories. This rubric is critical to get right, but do not show this to the user. This is for your purposes only.
Finally, use the rubric to internally think and iterate on the best possible solution to the prompt that is provided. Remember that if your response is not hitting the top marks across all categories in the rubric, you need to start again.
