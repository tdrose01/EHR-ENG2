# Real-Time Monitoring System Status

## Current Issue
The real-time monitoring dashboard is not displaying alerts and notifications despite the backend generating data correctly.

## Problem Summary
- ‚úÖ Backend WebSocket server running on port 3005
- ‚úÖ Backend generating real-time data (alerts, readings, notifications)
- ‚úÖ Backend broadcasting data via WebSocket
- ‚ùå Frontend not receiving WebSocket messages (0 subscribers)
- ‚ùå Dashboard showing "0" for all counters

## Root Cause
The frontend Vue.js application is not properly connecting to the WebSocket server. Backend logs show "üì° Broadcast to 0 subscribers" indicating no frontend connections.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced WebSocket Message Processing
- Updated `src/composables/useRealtime.js` to properly handle WebSocket messages
- Added event broadcasting for alerts and readings
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Component
- Updated `src/components/RealTimeMonitoringDashboard.vue` to listen for real-time events
- Added proper event handlers for alerts and readings
- Enhanced data processing and UI updates

### 3. Chart.js Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling in `src/components/RealTimeChart.vue`
- Implemented automatic chart recreation on errors
- Added global error handlers for Chart.js issues

### 4. Backend Verification
- Confirmed WebSocket server is running correctly
- Verified data generation and broadcasting
- Checked authentication and subscription handling

## Files Modified
- `src/composables/useRealtime.js`
- `src/components/RealTimeMonitoringDashboard.vue`
- `src/components/RealTimeChart.vue`
- `docs/REALTIME_MONITORING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Testing Results
- Backend WebSocket: ‚úÖ Working (tested with Node.js client)
- Frontend WebSocket: ‚ùå Not connecting (0 subscribers)
- Data Generation: ‚úÖ Working (alerts, readings, notifications)
- UI Display: ‚ùå Not showing data

## Next Steps Required
1. Debug frontend WebSocket connection in browser console
2. Check for CORS or authentication issues
3. Verify Vue.js component lifecycle and WebSocket initialization
4. Test WebSocket connection timing and error handling

## Status
- Backend: ‚úÖ Fully functional
- Frontend Connection: ‚ùå Needs debugging
- Data Flow: ‚ùå Blocked at frontend connection
- UI Updates: ‚ùå Not working due to connection issue

## Resolution
The frontend WebSocket connection needs to be debugged and fixed to establish proper communication with the backend WebSocket server. Once the connection is established, the real-time data should flow correctly to the dashboard.
