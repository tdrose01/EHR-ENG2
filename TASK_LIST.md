# Agent Workflow Task List

This list outlines the steps to run the complete, observable multi-agent workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status: PROJECT COMPLETE** âœ…

All project-related tasks have been completed. The agent workflow system is functional but currently has no pending tasks.

### **âœ… Completed Tasks:**
- [x] **Task 1: Start Developer Agent**: Run the `developer_agent.js` in the background to handle development tasks.
- [x] **Task 2: Start Test Agent**: Run the `test_agent.js` in the background to handle testing tasks.
- [x] **Task 3: Start Status Monitor**: Run the `status_monitor.js` in the foreground to provide a live dashboard of the task queue.
- [x] **Task 4: Run Orchestrator**: Execute the `orchestrator.js` to create the secure workspace and dispatch the initial tasks.

### **ðŸ”§ Issues Resolved:**
- [x] **File Path Bug**: Fixed `orchestrator.js` to write `workspace.txt` in project root instead of temporary workspace
- [x] **Agent Startup**: Agents now start correctly and process tasks from `PENDING` to `COMPLETE`
- [x] **Workflow Termination**: Fixed `run_agents.js` to properly terminate when all tasks are complete
- [x] **Code Review Agent**: Removed deprecated `CodeReviewAgent` from workflow

### **ðŸ“Š Current Task Queue:**
The task queue is currently empty. All project-related tasks have been completed.

### **ðŸš€ How to Run:**
```bash
# Run the complete workflow
node start_workflow.js

# Or run individual components
node orchestrator.js    # Create workspace and tasks
node run_agents.js      # Execute agents
node status_monitor.js  # Monitor progress
```
