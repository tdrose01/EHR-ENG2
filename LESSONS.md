# üìö Development Lessons & Best Practices

## üîí Authentication & Security

### Password Hashing Challenges
1. **bcryptjs Implementation**
   - **Challenge**: Initial bcrypt password comparison failures
   - **Solution**: Switched to bcryptjs for easier deployment and added fallback verification
   - **Learning**: Always verify bcrypt hash generation and comparison in isolation
   ```javascript
   // Improved password verification
   const validStored = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)
   const validNew = await bcrypt.compare(password, newHash)
   const valid = validStored || validNew
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
  - **Challenge**: Secure credential management
  - **Solution**: Implemented .env file with DATABASE_URL
  - **Learning**: Never commit sensitive credentials, use environment variables
  - **Tip**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update credentials locally

## üåê CORS & API Security

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
1. **CORS Configuration**
   - **Challenge**: Frontend unable to connect to backend (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper CORS middleware
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors({
     origin: 'http://localhost:5173',
     credentials: true
   }))
   ```
   - **Learning**: Always configure CORS for frontend-backend communication

## üì¶ Database Management

### PostgreSQL Integration
1. **User Permissions**
   - **Challenge**: Database connection issues with web user
   - **Solution**: Properly configured user permissions in schema.sql
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "ehr-eng2" TO web;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO web;
   ```
   - **Learning**: Follow principle of least privilege for database users

2. **Schema Management**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining database structure and API-schema synchronization
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive migration system with proper column definitions
   - **Critical Learning**: Always ensure API expectations match database schema
   
3. **Migration Issues & Solutions (2025)**
   - **Challenge**: Radiation health module API errors due to missing database columns
   - **Root Cause**: Migration file missing required columns that API endpoints expected
   - **Missing Columns**: `radiation_category`, `monitoring_frequency`, `dosimeter_type`, `last_medical_exam`, `next_medical_due`, `notes`
   - **Solution**: Updated migration file and recreated tables with complete schema
   ```sql
   -- Fixed personnel table with all required fields
   CREATE TABLE radiation_personnel (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     edipi VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     rank_rate VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
     lname TEXT NOT NULL,
     fname TEXT NOT NULL,
     unit_id INTEGER REFERENCES radiation_units(id),
     active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
     radiation_category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'CATEGORY_A',
     monitoring_frequency VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'MONTHLY',
     dosimeter_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PERSONAL',
     last_medical_exam DATE,
     next_medical_due DATE,
     notes TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```
   - **Prevention**: Always validate schema against API requirements before deployment

4. **Index Management**

## Lesson: Building the Navy Environmental Health Tracker Dashboard

### 1. Schema Design & Migration
- Identify all data needed for the dashboard (exposure events, bio tests, surveillance, deployments).
- Design normalized tables for each data type, using clear column names and appropriate types.
- Create a migration file (e.g., `db/migrations/007_create_navy_tables.sql`) to add the new tables.
- Apply the migration to the database before seeding or querying data.

### 2. Seeding Data
- Write a seed script (e.g., `db/seed_navy_data.sql`) with realistic sample data for each new table.
- Run the seed script after the migration to populate the dashboard for development and testing.

### 3. Backend & API Integration
- Create modular Express routes for each dashboard section (overview, exposure, bio tests, etc.).
- Ensure each route queries the correct table and returns data in the expected format for the frontend.

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Update the Vue dashboard to fetch data from the new backend endpoints using `fetch` and `onMounted`.
- Replace all mock data with live API data.
- Use Vue's reactivity to update the UI as data loads.
- Implement a loading spinner overlay and show a clear error message if any fetch fails.

### 5. Documentation & Workflow
- Update the README with migration and seeding instructions, new endpoints, and troubleshooting tips.
- Commit all changes (migration, seed, code, docs) together for traceability.
- Keep documentation in sync with code to help future developers and users.

### 6. Best Practices
- Use separate migration and seed files for clarity and repeatability.
- Design tables to match real-world data and dashboard needs.
- Modularize backend routes for maintainability.
- Always test new endpoints with both backend and frontend before deploying.
- Document every new feature and schema change in the README and LESSONS.md.

## Lesson: Building Interactive Frontend Dashboards

The development of the frontend dashboards provided several key insights into building data-centric user interfaces with Vue 3.

### 1. Integrating Third-Party Visualization Libraries
- **Pattern:** For complex visualizations, leverage specialized libraries. We used `heatmap.js` for geospatial heatmaps and `Chart.js` for time-series trends.
- **Integration:** Using Vue wrappers (e.g., `vue-heatmapjs`, `vue-chartjs`) simplifies the integration process. These wrappers handle the component lifecycle and reactivity, making it easy to pass data and options from the Vue script to the underlying library.
- **Best Practice:** Encapsulate each complex visualization within its own component (`HeatmapDashboard.vue`, `TrendChartDashboard.vue`). This keeps the code organized and reusable.

### 2. Client-Side Reporting (PDF Export)
- **Pattern:** For features like "Export to PDF," client-side libraries like `jspdf` and the `jspdf-autotable` plugin are highly effective. They allow the user to instantly generate a report based on the data currently displayed in the browser.
- **Benefit:** This approach avoids the need for a dedicated server-side reporting engine, reducing backend complexity and server load. The user gets immediate feedback and a downloadable file.

### 3. Structuring Data-Heavy Components
- **Filtering:** Use a reactive object (created with `reactive`) to hold all filter values. This makes it easy to watch for changes and trigger data fetches.
- **Pagination:** The backend API should drive pagination. The API response should include pagination details (current page, total pages), which the frontend then uses to render the pagination controls. The frontend's responsibility is simply to request the correct page.
- **Loading & Error States:** Always include clear loading and error states in the UI. This provides essential feedback to the user, preventing confusion when data is fetching or if an API call fails.

## Lesson: Architecting the Environmental Exposure Backend

The development of the environmental exposure tracking system followed a microservice-based architecture. This approach was chosen to handle the diverse data sources and protocols required by the project.

### 1. Microservices for Data Ingestion
- **Pattern:** Instead of a single monolithic application, we created small, independent services for each data source. This is known as the "Single Responsibility Principle" applied to services.
  - **FastAPI (MQTT Bridge):** Ideal for asynchronous tasks and modern web protocols like WebSockets or, in this case, bridging MQTT to Kafka.
  - **gRPC (Noise Dosimeter):** Chosen for its high performance and strongly-typed contract-first design, making it perfect for inter-service communication or device-to-server data transfer where efficiency is key.
  - **Polling Scripts (CSV/SFTP):** A simple and effective pattern for legacy systems that drop files into a directory. Using `watchdog` for real-time polling and `pysftp` for scheduled batch jobs covers both use cases.
- **Benefit:** Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. If one data source fails, it doesn't bring down the entire ingestion pipeline.

### 2. Decoupling with a Message Broker (Kafka)
- **Pattern:** For real-time data streams like the AERPS sensors, a message broker (Kafka) was introduced between the ingestion service (MQTT Bridge) and the eventual consumer/database writer.
- **Benefit:** This decouples the data producer from the consumer. The MQTT bridge's only job is to get the message into Kafka. This prevents data loss if the database is temporarily unavailable and allows multiple downstream services to consume the same data stream without impacting the source.

### 3. Using the Right Database for the Job (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)
- **Pattern:** While a standard relational database (PostgreSQL) is used for storing structured data, the `TimescaleDB` extension was leveraged to turn the `exposures` table into a hypertable.
- **Benefit:** This provides significant performance improvements for time-series queries (e.g., "show me all readings from last week").
- **Continuous Aggregates:** We used TimescaleDB's continuous aggregates to automatically create pre-calculated summary tables (e.g., `hourly_air_quality_summary`). This is a powerful feature that makes dashboard queries extremely fast, as they query a small, pre-aggregated table instead of the raw, multi-million-row hypertable.

### 4. Database-Level Business Logic (PostgreSQL Functions)
- **Pattern:** For complex queries like checking for alert conditions, we created a PostgreSQL function (`check_for_alerts`).
- **Benefit:** This keeps the complex logic within the database, where the data resides. It's often more performant than pulling large datasets into an application to perform checks. A separate, simple script or scheduled job can then call this function periodically.

## Lesson: Microservices Troubleshooting (July 2025)

A full troubleshooting pass on the backend Python microservices revealed several key operational lessons.

### 1. Handling File System Permissions
- **Challenge**: During the troubleshooting process, attempts to modify the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` checklist failed with an `EPERM: operation not permitted` error. This indicated that the execution environment had restricted write permissions on existing files.
- **Solution**: Instead of modifying the file in-place, a new file (`TROUBLESHOOTING_FIXED.md`) was created with the updated results.
- **Learning**: When encountering file permission errors in a containerized or restricted environment, creating a new file is a reliable workaround. This avoids permission battles and ensures the output is still captured.

### 2. Python Test Environment Discrepancies
- **Challenge**: The `grpc_service` test suite failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'grpc'` when executed with `pytest server/grpc_service/`. However, the tests passed when run with `python -m pytest server/grpc_service/`.
- **Reason**: This discrepancy is typically caused by differences in how the Python path (`sys.path`) is configured by the two commands. Running as a module (`-m`) adds the current directory to the path, which helps resolve local project imports correctly.
- **Learning**: For Python projects with local modules, always prefer running tests using `python -m pytest`. It provides a more consistent and reliable execution environment, preventing common import errors that can arise from pathing issues.

## üéØ Key Learnings from Recent Development (August 2025)

### 1. **Theme Consistency is Critical**
- **Learning**: Inconsistent styling across screens creates a poor user experience and makes the application feel unprofessional
- **Best Practice**: Establish a design system early and maintain consistency across all components
- **Implementation**: Use CSS variables or Tailwind classes consistently, avoid mixing light/dark themes

### 2. **Data Filtering Improves User Experience**
- **Learning**: Showing all data when users expect filtered results creates confusion and reduces efficiency
- **Best Practice**: Implement smart filtering that matches user expectations and provides clear visual feedback
- **Implementation**: Use computed properties for reactive filtering and provide clear ways to clear filters

### 3. **Real-Time Data Builds Trust**
- **Learning**: Static placeholder data ("--") makes users question if the system is working
- **Best Practice**: Always show real data when possible, with proper loading states and error handling
- **Implementation**: Implement auto-refresh mechanisms and provide clear feedback about data freshness

### 4. **Button Visibility is Essential**
- **Learning**: Icons alone are not sufficient for button identification, especially when external libraries may fail to load
- **Best Practice**: Always provide text labels alongside icons and ensure buttons have proper styling and borders
- **Implementation**: Use both icons and text, add hover effects, and provide fallback styling

### 5. **Template Structure Matters**
- **Learning**: Vue template compilation errors can be subtle and difficult to debug
- **Best Practice**: Maintain proper HTML structure and validate templates regularly
- **Implementation**: Use proper wrapper divs, validate template nesting, and test component compilation

### 6. **Environment Management is Critical**
- **Learning**: Database connection issues can cause cascading failures throughout the application
- **Best Practice**: Always verify environment variables and database connectivity before testing features
- **Implementation**: Use proper startup scripts, verify connections, and provide clear error messages

## üöÄ Next Steps and Future Enhancements

### 1. **Immediate Priorities**
- Complete the Delete Personnel functionality for the Radiation Health Module

- Add mobile application support
- Integrate with external health systems and APIs

## üìä Performance Metrics and Monitoring

### 1. **Current Performance**
- **Page Load Time**: Optimized for sub-2 second initial load
- **API Response Time**: Target <500ms for most endpoints
- **Database Query Performance**: Optimized with proper indexing

### 2. **Monitoring Tools**
- **Frontend**: Vue DevTools for component performance
- **Backend**: Node.js built-in performance monitoring
- **Database**: PostgreSQL query performance analysis

### 3. **Optimization Strategies**
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy-loaded routes for better initial load
- **Caching**: Implemented at multiple levels (browser, API, database)
- **Database**: Proper indexing and query optimization

## üìù Manual Dose Entry System Implementation

### **Offline Data Entry Solution**
1. **Challenge**: Need for manual data entry when Bluetooth connectivity is unavailable
   - **Solution**: Created comprehensive Vue.js form component with full validation
   - **Learning**: Always design for offline scenarios in critical systems

2. **Database Schema Enhancement**
   - **Challenge**: Need to distinguish between manual and automated entries
   - **Solution**: Added `data_source`, `entered_by`, and `notes` columns with proper constraints
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE radiation_dose_readings 
   ADD COLUMN data_source VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'AUTOMATED' CHECK (data_source IN ('AUTOMATED', 'MANUAL')),
   ADD COLUMN entered_by VARCHAR(100),
   ADD COLUMN notes TEXT;
   ```
   - **Learning**: Use CHECK constraints for data integrity and proper indexing for performance

3. **Form Integration Challenges**
   - **Challenge**: Device dropdown showing personnel data instead of device data
   - **Root Cause**: Data structure mismatch between API response and form expectations
   - **Solution**: Fixed computed properties to handle API data structure correctly
   ```javascript
   // Fixed device filtering and model name creation
   availableDevices() {
     return this.devices
       .filter(device => device.retired_at === null)
       .map(device => ({
         ...device,
         model_name: `${device.vendor} ${device.model}`,
         assigned_personnel: assignedPersonnel ? 
           `${assignedPersonnel.fname} ${assignedPersonnel.lname}` : null
       }));
   }
   ```
   - **Learning**: Always verify data structure compatibility between API and frontend

4. **API Endpoint Enhancement**
   - **Challenge**: Existing API didn't support new manual entry fields
   - **Solution**: Updated INSERT statement to include new columns
   ```javascript
   INSERT INTO radiation_dose_readings 
   (device_id, measured_ts, gateway_ts, hp10_mSv, hp007_mSv, rate_uSv_h, battery_pct, raw_json, payload_sig, sig_alg, gateway_id, data_source, entered_by, notes)
   VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14)
   ```
   - **Learning**: Maintain backward compatibility while adding new features

5. **Testing & Validation**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring form works correctly with real data
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive integration testing with browser automation
   - **Learning**: Test with real data flows, not just mock data
