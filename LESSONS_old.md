   - **Learning**: Always verify bcrypt hash generation and comparison in isolation
   ```javascript
   // Improved password verification
   const validStored = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)
   const validNew = await bcrypt.compare(password, newHash)
   const valid = validStored || validNew
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
  - **Challenge**: Secure credential management
  - **Solution**: Implemented .env file with DATABASE_URL
  - **Learning**: Never commit sensitive credentials, use environment variables
  - **Tip**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update credentials locally

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
1. **CORS Configuration**
   - **Challenge**: Frontend unable to connect to backend (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper CORS middleware
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors({
     origin: 'http://localhost:5173',
     credentials: true
   }))
   ```
   - **Learning**: Always configure CORS for frontend-backend communication

## üì¶ Database Management

### PostgreSQL Integration
1. **User Permissions**
   - **Challenge**: Database connection issues with web user

## Lesson: Building the Navy Environmental Health Tracker Dashboard

### 1. Schema Design & Migration
- Identify all data needed for the dashboard (exposure events, bio tests, surveillance, deployments).
- Design normalized tables for each data type, using clear column names and appropriate types.
- Create a migration file (e.g., `db/migrations/007_create_navy_tables.sql`) to add the new tables.
- Apply the migration to the database before seeding or querying data.

### 2. Seeding Data
- Write a seed script (e.g., `db/seed_navy_data.sql`) with realistic sample data for each new table.
- Run the seed script after the migration to populate the dashboard for development and testing.

### 3. Backend & API Integration
- Create modular Express routes for each dashboard section (overview, exposure, bio tests, etc.).
- Ensure each route queries the correct table and returns data in the expected format for the frontend.

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Update the Vue dashboard to fetch data from the new backend endpoints using `fetch` and `onMounted`.
- Replace all mock data with live API data.
- Use Vue's reactivity to update the UI as data loads.
- Implement a loading spinner overlay and show a clear error message if any fetch fails.

### 5. Documentation & Workflow
- Update the README with migration and seeding instructions, new endpoints, and troubleshooting tips.
- Commit all changes (migration, seed, code, docs) together for traceability.
- Keep documentation in sync with code to help future developers and users.

### 6. Best Practices
- Use separate migration and seed files for clarity and repeatability.
- Design tables to match real-world data and dashboard needs.
- Modularize backend routes for maintainability.
- Always test new endpoints with both backend and frontend before deploying.
- Document every new feature and schema change in the README and LESSONS.md.

## Lesson: Building Interactive Frontend Dashboards

The development of the frontend dashboards provided several key insights into building data-centric user interfaces with Vue 3.

### 1. Integrating Third-Party Visualization Libraries
- **Pattern:** For complex visualizations, leverage specialized libraries. We used `heatmap.js` for geospatial heatmaps and `Chart.js` for time-series trends.
- **Integration:** Using Vue wrappers (e.g., `vue-heatmapjs`, `vue-chartjs`) simplifies the integration process. These wrappers handle the component lifecycle and reactivity, making it easy to pass data and options from the Vue script to the underlying library.
- **Best Practice:** Encapsulate each complex visualization within its own component (`HeatmapDashboard.vue`, `TrendChartDashboard.vue`). This keeps the code organized and reusable.

### 2. Client-Side Reporting (PDF Export)
- **Pattern:** For features like "Export to PDF," client-side libraries like `jspdf` and the `jspdf-autotable` plugin are highly effective. They allow the user to instantly generate a report based on the data currently displayed in the browser.
- **Benefit:** This approach avoids the need for a dedicated server-side reporting engine, reducing backend complexity and server load. The user gets immediate feedback and a downloadable file.

### 3. Structuring Data-Heavy Components
- **Filtering:** Use a reactive object (created with `reactive`) to hold all filter values. This makes it easy to watch for changes and trigger data fetches.
- **Pagination:** The backend API should drive pagination. The API response should include pagination details (current page, total pages), which the frontend then uses to render the pagination controls. The frontend's responsibility is simply to request the correct page.
- **Loading & Error States:** Always include clear loading and error states in the UI. This provides essential feedback to the user, preventing confusion when data is fetching or if an API call fails.

## Lesson: Architecting the Environmental Exposure Backend

The development of the environmental exposure tracking system followed a microservice-based architecture. This approach was chosen to handle the diverse data sources and protocols required by the project.

### 1. Microservices for Data Ingestion
- **Pattern:** Instead of a single monolithic application, we created small, independent services for each data source. This is known as the "Single Responsibility Principle" applied to services.
  - **FastAPI (MQTT Bridge):** Ideal for asynchronous tasks and modern web protocols like WebSockets or, in this case, bridging MQTT to Kafka.
  - **gRPC (Noise Dosimeter):** Chosen for its high performance and strongly-typed contract-first design, making it perfect for inter-service communication or device-to-server data transfer where efficiency is key.
  - **Polling Scripts (CSV/SFTP):** A simple and effective pattern for legacy systems that drop files into a directory. Using `watchdog` for real-time polling and `pysftp` for scheduled batch jobs covers both use cases.
- **Benefit:** Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. If one data source fails, it doesn't bring down the entire ingestion pipeline.

### 2. Decoupling with a Message Broker (Kafka)
- **Pattern:** For real-time data streams like the AERPS sensors, a message broker (Kafka) was introduced between the ingestion service (MQTT Bridge) and the eventual consumer/database writer.
- **Benefit:** This decouples the data producer from the consumer. The MQTT bridge's only job is to get the message into Kafka. This prevents data loss if the database is temporarily unavailable and allows multiple downstream services to consume the same data stream without impacting the source.

### 3. Using the Right Database for the Job (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)
- **Pattern:** While a standard relational database (PostgreSQL) is used for storing structured data, the `TimescaleDB` extension was leveraged to turn the `exposures` table into a hypertable.
- **Benefit:** This provides significant performance improvements for time-series queries (e.g., "show me all readings from last week").
- **Continuous Aggregates:** We used TimescaleDB's continuous aggregates to automatically create pre-calculated summary tables (e.g., `hourly_air_quality_summary`). This is a powerful feature that makes dashboard queries extremely fast, as they query a small, pre-aggregated table instead of the raw, multi-million-row hypertable.

### 4. Database-Level Business Logic (PostgreSQL Functions)
- **Pattern:** For complex queries like checking for alert conditions, we created a PostgreSQL function (`check_for_alerts`).
- **Benefit:** This keeps the complex logic within the database, where the data resides. It's often more performant than pulling large datasets into an application to perform checks. A separate, simple script or scheduled job can then call this function periodically.
