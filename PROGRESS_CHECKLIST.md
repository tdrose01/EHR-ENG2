# Progress Checklist

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundational Setup**
    - [x] Create `developer_agent.js` for code generation.
    - [x] Create `test_agent.js` for test generation.
    - [x] Create `orchestrator.js` to manage the workspace and create tasks.
    - [x] Identify the need for a "pane of glass" to see agent progress.
    - [x] Create `status_monitor.js` to provide a live dashboard view.

- [x] **Phase 2: Debugging "Stuck on PENDING" Issue**
    - [x] **Symptom:** Tasks are created but remain in `PENDING` status. The `developer_agent` fails to start them.
    - [x] **Attempt 1 (File Path Bug):** Corrected a bug where the workspace path was not being trimmed, causing agents to look in the wrong directory.
    - [x] **Attempt 2 (Logging):** Added detailed logging to agent files to trace their execution, but discovered the logs were not appearing in the console.
    - [x] **Current Step: Verify Node.js Environment:** Confirmed that the basic `console.log` function is working as expected.

- [x] **Phase 3: Resolution**
    - [x] **Analyze Environment Test:** The test passed, confirming `console.log` is not the issue.
    - [x] **Identify Root Cause:** The agent scripts were never executed. The `orchestrator.js` script only creates the workspace and tasks; it does not run the agents.
    - [x] **Implement Fix:** Created a new `start_workflow.js` script to manage the entire process:
        1. Starts `status_monitor.js` for live progress tracking.
        2. Runs `orchestrator.js` to set up the environment.
        3. Runs `run_agents.js` to execute the agents once setup is complete.
    - [x] **Next Step:** Run the full, observable workflow using `node start_workflow.js` to confirm tasks transition from `PENDING` to `COMPLETE`.
- [x] **Phase 4: Final Verification**
    - [x] **Symptom:** Workflow hangs after all tasks are marked as `COMPLETE`.
    - [x] **Identify Root Cause:** The `run_agents.js` script did not terminate after completing all tasks, causing the parent `start_workflow.js` to wait indefinitely.
    - [x] **Implement Fix:** Modified `run_agents.js` to poll the task queue and exit when all tasks are `COMPLETE`.
    - [x] **Verification:** Ran the final workflow and confirmed that it executed all tasks and terminated correctly.
    - [x] **Final Check:** Verified that the agent-generated code and tests were created as expected.
- [x] **Conclusion: The automated agent workflow is now fully functional.**

- [ ] **Phase 5: Refactoring the Workflow**
    - [x] **Symptom:** A new `orchestrator.js` was introduced, but the session ended before the workflow could be fully updated.
    - [x] **Identify Root Cause:** The new orchestrator defines tasks for `DeveloperAgent` and `TestAgent` only, but `run_agents.js` was still trying to run `CodeReviewAgent`, which would cause a hang.
    - [x] **Implement Fix:** Removed the `CodeReviewAgent` from `run_agents.js` to align with the new task structure.
    - [ ] **Next Step:** Run the refactored workflow using `start_workflow.js` to ensure the developer and test agents complete their tasks successfully.

- [ ] **Phase 6: Debugging "Stuck on PENDING" - Part 2**
    - [x] **Symptom:** Tasks remain in `PENDING` status even after the previous fix.
    - [x] **Identify Root Cause:** A bug in `orchestrator.js` was causing it to write the `workspace.txt` file inside the temporary workspace instead of the project root. This prevented `run_agents.js` from finding the workspace and starting the agents.
    - [x] **Implement Fix:** Corrected the file path in `orchestrator.js` to ensure `workspace.txt` is created in the project's root directory.
    - [ ] **Next Step:** Run the complete workflow again with `node start_workflow.js` to verify that the agents now start correctly and process their tasks.
